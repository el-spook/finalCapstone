            <h2>About Me, an Avid Non-Climber</h2>
            <p>I'm Jess, an armchair mountaineer. While I love hiking and the outdoors, there is never any chance of me climbing any sort of mountain where climbing skills are needed (as I have none), or where there is any risk of altitude sickness, avalanches, frostbite, or if there's a need to camp in temperatures below 10&#8451, or where I'd have to navigate heights. That definitely rules out most mountains above 3000 metres, and probably most that are less than that.</p>
            <p>As is probably clear, I'm extremely risk averse, and that's no doubt why I'm slightly obsessed with the people who risk everything to get to the top of the world's highest peaks.</p>
