            <h2>The beauty, the risks, the irrationality.</h2>
            <blockquote>"The element of risk - the attraction of risk - is an inherent part of climbing. It's very, very addictive as well, and so it's a matter of going into a dangerous situation and using your skill and your ability to actually overcome that risk and danger. And when you've done a series of very hard moves, when you've got out of a really desperate situation, there's an extraordinary exhilaration, euphoria almost, in that process."</blockquote>

        <h2>The Mountains</h2>
        <p>Even amongst the 8000ers, mountains are not created equal. Although it was the first to be summited, Annapurna I is still renowned as one of the most dangerous mountains to climb. It is only because of recent successes that its fatality rate has fallen from 32% (the worst of any mountain) to just under 20%, while estimates of K2's fatality rate are around 24%.</p>
        <p>All 8000ers have common dangers: avalanche risks, extremely unpredictable weather, exposure to sudden and violent storms, and temperatures regularly below 30&#8451.  </p>
        <p>However, each mountain also has its own peculiarities that make it potentially lethal: on Everest, there is the dangerous Khumbu Icefall and the fact that the mountain stretches almost 849 metres into the death zone, while four of the 8000er peaks are between 8000 and 8100 metres. K2, meanwhile, is not only a much more technical climb with unique sections of risk, but its more northerly location makes for harsher and more sudden changes in weather. This is reflected in the fact that it was the last 8000er to be summited in Winter, as recently as 2021.</p>
        <p>Once Everest was successfully climbed by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepali-Indian mountaineer Tenzing Norgay in 1953, successful summits of the remaining 12 unclimbed peaks quickly followed. By 1961, only one was left, and it was the baby of the group, Shishapangma, at 8027 metres. It wasn't due to being more difficult that Shishapangma wasn't climbed until 1964, over a decade after the first Everest summit, but because Chinese authorities carefully controlled access to the mountain: it is the only 8000er that is located only within Chinese-controlled Tibet. Sure enough, the first ascent was by a Chinese team.</p>
        <p>Huge mountain ranges make for effective boundaries between nations, which is why nine of the fourteen 8000s are located on borders: four lie on the border of Nepal and Chinese-controlled Tibet; another four are shared between Pakistan and China; another is on the border of Nepal and India. Of the remaining five, three are in Nepal, one is in Pakistan, and one (the aforementioned Shishapangma) is in Tibet. </p>
