        <h2>The Dangers</h2>
        <p>The quotations at the top of every page of this site are all by people who have experienced tragedy at close quarters on the 8000ers:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Norwegian Cecilie Skog successfully summited K2 in 2008, but during that attempt, eleven other mountaineers died, including her husband.</li>
            <li>British mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington has led and organised several expeditions on 8000ers, and lost members of his team on Everest, K2 and Annapurna.</li>
            <li>Pakistani mountaineer Muhammad Ali Sadpara sadly lost his life helping Icelandic adventurer John Snorri try to make a Winter summit of K2, just two weeks after the first successful Winter ascent was made by a group of ten Nepalese climbers from three different companies.</li>
            <li>American climber and journalist Jon Krakauer survived the 1996 "Mount Everest Disaster" in which eight people died.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>The dangers of climbing 8000ers are too many to list in their entirety, but here are a sample to illustrate just how treacherous climbing 8000ers is, and how lucky someone must be (alongside being extremely physically fit and well-prepared) to successfully summit a peak and return home alive.</p>

        <h3>The Weather</h3>
        <p>The jet stream is a core of some of the strongest winds in the atmosphere, moving around 5 to 7 miles above the Earth's surface. The wind speeds tend to range from 80 to 140 miles per hour, but can reach more than 275 miles per hour. They are faster, and lower in the atmosphere, in winter. </p>
        <p>This means that many 8000ers pierce the jet stream, particularly in winter, making their upper reaches, let alone their summits, completely unreachable for most of the year. The jet stream, and other winds, make forecasting the weather for summit attempts extremely difficult. The majority of abandoned climbing attempts are usually due to extreme winds, including blizzards.</p>
        <p>While most people can imagine being buffeted by high winds, winds with this much power would be unimaginable to most of us. To put these wind speeds into context, a category 3 hurrican has winds of 111 to 129 mph, and will cause devastating damage. Winds of 130 mph and higher will cause catastrophic damage, with most trees uprooted and power poles downed. Surviving on a mountain in such conditions is impossible.</p>

        <h3>The Temperature</h3>
        <p>As altitude increases, the temperature decreases rapidly in the troposphere. The sun's rays don't warm the air here: they pass easily through to the earth.</p>
        <p>On Everest, the average wind chill equivalent temperature is -45&#8451 during the climbing season, and closer to -65&#8451 in midwinter. In the normal climbing season, then, it takes only 7 minutes for frostbite to start affecting the face. In winter, it can take less than a minute.</p>
        <p>At such temperatures, the risk of hypothermia is very great, especially if a climber stops moving and their core body temperature decreases.</p>

        <h3>Avalanches and Serac Falls</h3>
        <p>Avalanches can occur on any snow-covered mountain, and the longer someone is on a mountain, the greater the risk of being affected by one. The extreme weather conditions on the 8000ers make avalanches even more likely.</p>
        <p>In addition, many 8000ers are covered in glacial ice, a block or column of which is called a serac. On K2, part of the route to the summit involves navigating a section right under overhanging seracs, which may dislodge and fall at any point. The most commonly used route on Everest involves navigating the Khumbu Icefall to get from Base Camp to Camp 1, which is full of seracs that are house-sized or larger, and which may topple with little warning.</p> 
        <p>The climate crisis has ony increased the likelihood of both avalanches and serac falls.</p>

        <h3>Air Pressure</h3>
        <p>Atmospheric pressure, known as barometric pressure, is typically 1013.25 millibars at sea level, where it is at its highest. All animals (unless they are birds with special adaptations, like the Ruppell griffon vulture) require the weight of air to be able to breathe. But at higher altitudes and lower temperatures, barometric pressure gets very low.</p>
        <p>On Everest, the barometric pressure is around 333 millibars, less than a third of what it is at sea level. This makes the speed of vertical ascent extremely slow for climbers, as oxygen is so necessary for muscles to move: it can take over an hour to ascend 100 metres, and that requires rapid, shallow breathing (around 80 breaths per minute), even with supplementary oxygen. Scientists listening to recordings of climbers on the Everest summit have compared them to patients in the last stages of respiratory failure.</p> 
        <p>Low barometric pressure also profoundly effects cognitive abilities, potentially leading to fatal decisions, and there is evidence to suggest that this cognitive impairment lasts even 12 months after returning to a healthy air pressure.</p>
        <p>Some people are more or less tolerant to a lack of oxygen, and this isn't reflective of a person's physical fitness, just genetics and luck.</p>

        <h3>Altitude</h3>
        <p>According to one definition, 1500 to 3500 metres above sea level is considered high altitude. 5500 to 8850 is beyond very high - it's defined as "extreme altitude".</p>
        <p>At such altitudes, people are susceptible to developing altitude sickness, which might then lead to a variety of potentially fatal conditions.</p>
        <p>Altitude sickness occurs due to rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen. It could include headache, nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting. To avoid altitude sickness, climbers on 8000ers often spend weeks acclimatising to the altitude. This often involves going up and down mountains between fixed camps in an attempt to get the body and brain used to the low air pressure more gradually. Again, someone's likelihood to suffer from altitude sickness is genetic and not based on physical fitness.</p>
        <p>Altitude sickness can develop into HAPE (high altitude pulmonary edema) or HACE (high altitude cerebral edema). Given the lack of access to emergency medical treatment on mountains, suffering from either or both can become extremely dangerous very quickly. HAPE affects the lungs and the lack of oxygen can then affect the heart (deaths from cardiac events are therefore common on 8000ers), while HACE effects the brain, causing disorientation, lethargy and sometimes hallucinations. Untreated patients often die within 48 hours.</p>
