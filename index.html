        <h2>Life Above 8 Kilometres</h2>
        <p>Everyone has heard of Mount Everest, knowing that it's the highest point on the planet. Most people have also heard of K2, the second tallest mountain, and they might know that climbing it is an even more dangerous pursuit than taking on Everest.</p> 
        <p>Fewer people are aware that Everest and K2 are just the tallest of fourteen mountains that reach above eight-thousand metres (well over 26,000 feet), a point so high in the troposphere that all mammals begin dying. Only a handful of birds are known to reach such heights.</p>
        <p>This special group of mountains is collectively known as the 8000ers. Amongst mountaineers, the point above 8000 metres is called "the death zone".</p>
        <p>In spite of the extreme environment, every year there are hundreds of people who take on the challenge of reaching the summits of these natural wonders, effectively racing against their own deaths. This site hopes to give a small background to the wonder of the mountains, what makes them so dangerous, and why, to some, they are irresistible.</p>
